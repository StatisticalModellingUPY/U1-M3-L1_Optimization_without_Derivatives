In what concerns us, we can distinguish two kind of functions, those with a single minimum (global minimum) and those with multiple minima (possible several local minima, and a global minimum). The former are called *convex functions*, while the latter are called *non-convex*. The distinction is important because many optimization methods can only guarantee finding a local minimum, and, if the function is *non-convex*, the global minimum may elude us. Since convex functions possess only one minimum, the global minimum, we can be sure the algorithm will converge to it. On the other hand, trying to find the global minimum of non-convex function can be prohibitively expensive (computationally speaking).\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, onto the Nelder-Mead algorithm. The Nelder-Mead method uses a geometrical shape called a simplex as its 'vehicle' of sorts to search the domain. This is why the technique is also called the Simplex search method. In layman's terms, a simplex is the n-dimensional version of a 'triangle'. For 1 dimension, its a line, for 2 dimensions, its a triangle, for 3 dimensions, its a tetrahedron, etc. The shape doesn't have to be symmetrical/equilateral in any way. Note that an n-dimensional simplex has (n+1) vertexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method does not require any derivative information, which makes it suitable for problems with non-smooth functions. It is widely used to solve parameter estimation and similar statistical problems, where the function values are uncertain or subject to noise. It can also be used for problems with discontinuous functions, which occur frequently in statistics and experimental mathematics."

    "We start by considering the 1D case, for which the simplex is a line. One simple thing to try would be to sample two points relatively near each other, and just repeatedly take a step down away from the largest value. The obvious problem in this approach is using a fixed step size: it can't get closer to the true minima than the step size so it doesn't converge. It also spends too much time inching towards the minima when it's clear that the step size should be larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these problems, the Nelder-Mead method dynamically adjusts the step size based off the loss of the new point. If the new point is better than any previously seen value, it expands the step size to accelerate towards the bottom. Likewise if the new point is worse it contracts the step size to converge around the minima. The algorithm is implemented in the `optimize.minimize` function. To use it, you need to pass the option `method=\"Nelder-Mead\"` to `minimize`. Let's test in a non-trivial function:\n",

In an ideal case, the last few iterations of this algorithm would involve the simplex shrinking inwards towards the best point inside it. At the end, the vertex of the simplex that yields that most optimal objective value, is returned. The general algorithm is given below.\n",

    "One iteration of the Nelder-Mead method consists of the following three steps:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "c = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\neq h} x_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformation**. This is the most important part of the whole process – transforming the simplex. Transformation takes place in one of the following ways:\n",
    "  1. **Reflection**. This is the first type of transformation that is tried out. You compute the 'reflected' point as:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x_r = c + \\alpha(c - x_h)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  $\\alpha$ is called the reflection parameter, and is usually equal to one. $x_r$ is essentially a point on the line joining $c$ and $x_h$, but located away from $x_h$. This is done in an attempt to move the simplex in a direction thats away from the sub-optimal region around $x_h$. For a 2-D problem, heres what reflection looks like:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ![](images/neldermead_1.jpg)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Now, if $f(x_s) > f(x_r) \\geq f(x_l)$ -- that is, that $x_r$ is better than the second-worst point, but not better than the current best, we just replace $x_h$ with $x_r$ in the simplex, and move on to the next iteration.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. **Expansion**. If our luck is great and the reflected point $x_r$ happens to be better than the current best ($f(x_r) < f(x_l)$), we try to explore the possibility further.  In other words, we move a little bit more in the direction of $x_r$ from c, in the hope of finding an even better solution. The expanded point is defined as:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x_e = c + \\gamma(x_r - c)\n",

    "  \n",
    "  ![](images/neldermead_2.jpg)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We then replace $x_h$ with the better of the two points: $x_e$ and $x_r$ in the simplex. This is called 'greedy optimization' -- we have replaced the worst point with the better of the two options we had. Theres another variant called 'greedy expansion', which replaces $x_h$ with $x_e$, as long as $f(x_e) < f(x_l)$. This is done irrespective of whether $x_e$ is better than $x_r$. The intuition for this, comes from the fact that Expansion always leads to a bigger simplex, which means more exploration of the search space.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. **Contraction**. Suppose our reflection point was worst than $x_s$ (i.e. the second worst point). In that case, we need to realize that the direction defined by $x_r$ may not be the ideal one for moving. Therefore, we end up contracting our simplex. The contraction point x_c is defined as:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x_c = c + \\beta(\\min(x_h, x_r) - c)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  The simplex contracts respect to the better of $x_h$ or $x_r$. $\\beta$ is called the contraction parameter, and is usually equal to 0.5. In essence, we try to go against our exploration, instead contracting the simplex. An 'inward' 2-D contraction looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](images/neldermead_3.jpg)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  If $f(x_c) < f(\\min(x_h, x_r))$, which means that the contracted point is better than the current-worst, then we replace $x_h$ with $x_c$ in the simplex. However, if this is not the case, then we go to our last resort: the Shrink contraction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. **Shrink contraction**. In this case, we redefine the entire simplex. We only keep the best point ($x_l$), and define all others with respect to it and the previous points. The j$^{th}$ new point, will now be defined as:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x_j = x_l + \\delta (x_j - x_l)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\delta is called the shrinkage parameter, and is equal to 0.5 in most implementations. What we are essentially doing with the above definition, is moving each point in the simplex towards the current best point, in the hope of converging onto the best neighborhood. A 2-D Shrinking transformation looks like:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ![](images/neldermead_5.jpg)\n",
    "  \n",
